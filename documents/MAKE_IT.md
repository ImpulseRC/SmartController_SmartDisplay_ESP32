# How to make the your own ?

All electronic designs and software are open source. So, you can easily make your own board if you have some electronic skills.

## Produce the board with [JLCPBC](https://jlcpcb.com/)

The first step is : produce your board.
JLCPCB has interesting capacities : [PCB assembly](https://jlcpcb.com/smt-assembly).
They print your PCB and solder components on it.

It cost arround 40/50â‚¬ to produce the board.

The issue : they don't have all components.

You'll have to order the missing components on aliexpress or any electronic store and solder it yourself.

The major non included components are :
- SMD relays
- connectors
- Power supply capacitor
- Solid State Relay (DIP4 package)

Check the electronic project link on the [main github page](https://github.com/Koxx3/SmartController_SmartDisplay_ESP32#Schematics)

# After ordering the board PCB

Order the missing components !

Don't forget to order connectors :
- JST SM (2/3/6 pins)
- JST PH 2.0 (2/3/6 pins)

You can also add the external  :
- WCS1700 : current sensor
- Expansion boards (PRO version only)

# Finish with ESP32

- leave right pin on the right unconnected (unused)
- USB port on the left side

# Wrap it
You need a wrap for 10.5cm / diameter 33mm
